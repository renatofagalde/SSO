# SSO Project
Single Sign On with Spring Security and Keycloack
The goal of this project is use Authentication and Authorization with Spring Security and Keycloak.

The project will be build running keycloak over docker and Spring with thymeleaf, the propouse is Keycloak.

I really don't like to use this way in my production projects.

Use SSO Sub context to test the SSO.
